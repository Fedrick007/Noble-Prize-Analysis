# 🏅 Nobel Prize Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the **Nobel Prize dataset** to uncover patterns and trends related to:

- Prize distribution over time
- Gender representation across categories
- Age trends of Nobel laureates
- Country-wise contribution to Nobel Prizes
- Category-wise comparisons

The analysis uses **Python data science libraries** and focuses on producing **clear, meaningful visualizations** and **data-driven insights**.

---

## 🧠 Key Questions Explored

- How has the number of Nobel Prizes changed over time?
- Which countries have produced the most Nobel laureates?
- How does winning age vary across categories and years?
- What is the gender distribution across Nobel Prize categories?
- Are there noticeable trends or shifts over decades?

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data cleaning, grouping, aggregation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – base plotting
- **Seaborn** – statistical visualizations
- **Plotly** – interactive maps and charts
- **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis and presentation

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed

### 🔹 Time-Based Analysis
- Number of prizes awarded per year
- Rolling averages to observe long-term trends
- Impact of historical events on prize distribution

### 🔹 Demographic Analysis
- Gender comparison across prize categories
- Winning age trends over time
- Category-wise age distribution using boxplots

### 🔹 Geographic Analysis
- Country-wise prize counts
- Cumulative prizes per country over time
- Interactive world maps using ISO country codes

### 🔹 Category Analysis
- Comparison of prize trends across categories
- Faceted regression plots to study category-specific patterns

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included

- Scatter plots with LOWESS smoothing
- Box plots for age distributions
- Bar charts for gender and category counts
- Choropleth world maps
- Faceted regression plots by category

All plots are styled for **clarity, readability, and professional presentation**.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Nobel Prizes are not evenly distributed across time or geography
- Certain countries dominate prize counts over decades
- Winning age shows different trends depending on category
- Gender representation varies significantly across fields
- Long-term trends are clearer when using rolling averages

---


## ⚠️ Limitations

- Analysis depends on the completeness of historical records
- Some fields contain missing demographic information
- Correlation does not imply causation

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add interactive dashboards
- Include text analysis of laureate motivations
- Compare Nobel data with global education or research funding
- Apply predictive modeling on future prize trends

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **data analysis and visualization** can uncover meaningful insights from historical datasets.  
It highlights the power of **EDA, grouping, aggregation, and visualization techniques** in understanding long-term global trends.
